Loady - the Java static class to facilitate the dynamic loading of classes.

This project includes a single Java class (SrcLoader) to help load '.class' files (either a single file at a time, or several files found
in a Jar) or even '.java' files (Loady compiles the files nad then loads and deletes the compiled '.class' file).

I hope this will help some one some time :)
